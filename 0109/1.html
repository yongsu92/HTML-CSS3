        <p>Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA), in which competitors are subject to few limited restrictions[1] on their swimming stroke. Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with 50 meters (50 yards) and reaching 1500 meters (1650 yards),[2] also known as the mile. The term 'freestyle stroke' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl',[3] as front crawl is the fastest swimming stroke. It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions.</p>
